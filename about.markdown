  <p>
    I'm Sohan, a third-year CS major at Manipal Institute of Technology. I have a strong interest in NLP, large language models, and reinforcement learning. I've interned at Infosys as a project intern and at Fellowship.ai as a data science fellow. I aim to build a career in AI with an ultimate focus on building AI systems that are safe, efficient, and generalizable.
