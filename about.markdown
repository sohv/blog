I'm Sohan. I'm a third year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology. I have a keen interest in computer vision, reinforcement learning and explainable AI. I have previously interned at Infosys and Launchpad. I hope to build a career in AI, contributing to impactful projects that address real-world issues.
