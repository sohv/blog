I'm Sohan. I'm a third year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology. I have a keen interest in computer vision, reinforcement learning and explainable AI. I have previously interned at Infosys and Launchpad. I hope to build a career in AI, contributing to impactful projects that address real-world issues.

In this blog, I'll be writing on exciting topics in computer vision, generative AI and software engineering. I'll also be sharing updates on my projects and reviewing cutting-edge AI research papers. My blog posts will be entirely original with proper references listed promptly.
